MATLAB scripts for calculating isochron burial age using paired cosmogenic nuclides.

June 10, 2022

The MATLAB script "york_Vermeesch.m" was ported from "York.R" which was written in R language and included in a toolbox called IsoplotR by Vermeesch, 2018. Other .m-files in this directory were written by Yizhou Yang. See file "NOTICE" for copyright and licensing notice pertaining to all .m-files in this directory.
